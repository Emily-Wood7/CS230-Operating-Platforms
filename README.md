•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted a web-based version of a gaming app.  Their game will render images that players will then try to guess.  The game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved, each team will have multiple players assigned to it, game and team names must be unique, and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.


•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was able to organize the content in a way that was clear to the reader.


•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped with defining the needs and requirements of the clients.  This helped outline the needed code.
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have been more thorough.  I have a habit of being to the point and succinct.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
With this project, the user’s needs were laid out specifically, so I didn’t find much difficulty interpreting them.  It is extremely important to consider the user’s needs when designing because ultimately, if they’re unhappy, the client is unhappy.
•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by listening to the user’s needs, clarifying specifics, and understanding who the end user would be.  I would use more technical strategies in the future, such as asking about system requirements, understanding security needs, and implementing the design constraints.
